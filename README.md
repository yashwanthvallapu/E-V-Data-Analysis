**Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard**
This project presents an interactive
dashboard that analyzes Electric Vehicle
(EV) data across multiple dimensions. 
It includes:
Key Metrics: Average electric range, total
vehicles, BEV and PHEV distribution
Trends: Vehicles by model year
Geographic Insights: EV distribution by state
Top Contributors: Leading manufacturers and models by total vehicles
Policy Insight: CAVF eligibility status breakdown

**KPIâ€™S Requirement:**
1. Total Vehicles:
Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.

2. Electric Range:Average
Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:
Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.

**Charts Requirement:**
**Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards):**
